                                    Many issues can contribute to sub-optimal performance (ISP, location, censorship, settings, etc). The TunnelBear team goes to exceptional lengths to satisfy users who experience sub-optimal performance or the occasional outage. However, TunnelBear does not offer financial reimbursement due to these issues.
